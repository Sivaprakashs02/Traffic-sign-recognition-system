## 📖 Introduction

Automatic traffic sign recognition is a crucial component in intelligent transportation and autonomous driving systems. This project uses Python and popular machine learning libraries to build a robust classifier that can recognize various traffic signs from images. The core script, `traffic_sign_recognition.py`, demonstrates data handling, model training, and prediction workflows.

## ✨ Features

- 🖼️ **Image Preprocessing:** Efficient reading and preprocessing of traffic sign images.
- 🔎 **Model Training:** Utilizes deep learning (TensorFlow/Keras) for high-accuracy classification.
- 📊 **Visualization:** Plots and visualizes results for better understanding.
- 🗂️ **Data Handling:** Splits data for training and testing using `scikit-learn`.
- 🔤 **Label Encoding:** Converts labels to categorical format for model compatibility.
